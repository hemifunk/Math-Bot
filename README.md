> MathBot is a telegram bot for helping high school final exams - specified in 5 points in Math (for the Israeli program of MOE).

## Motivation
*After the October 7th war we offer a free Math Bot that can help students to learn by using the phone only - since many of the evacuted remained with nothing at all except their mobile cellphones.*
*Hopefully this will help them maximize their grade in the final exam and stay connected with people who have the same struggle in the same material.*

## Complementary features
